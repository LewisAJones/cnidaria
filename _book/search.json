Well, it means you can follow along on this journey over the coming months, years, or however long it takes me to write this‚Ä¶   I‚Äôve always considered writing a book a daunting task and perhaps a lonely one. This is why I‚Äôve chosen to write this book out of the attic. It‚Äôs an experiment of mine. I wanted to see if sharing this journey with you, and receiving feedback during the process could make this all a little more fun, and hopefully a fairer representation of Cnidaria!\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by Ganapathy Kumar at Unsplash"
