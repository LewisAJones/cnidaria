Well, it means that you can follow along on this journey over the coming months, years, or however long it takes me to complete this edition. I’ve always considered writing a book a daunting task and perhaps a lonely one. This is why I’ve chosen to write this book out of the attic. It’s an experiment of mine. I wanted to see if sharing this journey with you, and receiving your comments during this process could make this all a little more fun, and hopefully a fairer representation of the field!\n\n\n\n\nPhotograph by Ganapathy Kumar"
