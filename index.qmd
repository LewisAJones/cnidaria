# Welcome {.unnumbered}

This is the website for the 1^st^ edition of **The Cnidarians**. This book is currently being written... in the open. The information presented here is a work in progress and should be taken as such. This is likely to be quite the adventure, and I welcome you to follow along over the coming months, years or however long it takes me to write this...
