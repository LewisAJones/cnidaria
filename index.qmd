This website hosts **The Cnidarians**. A book about... you guessed it, Cnidaria.
<br>
<br>
*The book is currently being written...* ***IN THE OPEN!*** ðŸ˜± 
<br>
<br>
What does that mean exactly? Well, it means that **you can follow along on this journey** over the coming months and/or years? And hopefully not decades.
<br>
<br>
I've always considered writing a book a daunting task and perhaps a lonely one. This is why I've chosen to write this book *out of the attic*. It's an experiment of mine. I wanted to see if sharing this journey with you, and receiving feedback during the process could make this all a little more fun, and hopefully a fairer representation of Cnidaria!
